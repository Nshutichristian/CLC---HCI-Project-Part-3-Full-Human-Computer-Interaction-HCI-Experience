## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project is an immersive HCI experience developed in Unity 2022.3.40f1 targeting Meta Quest 2. The theme is **Environmental Exploration**, where users explore forest, beach, and hut biomes, interact with animals and scientific elements, and experience immersive effects like fog and fire. The system demonstrates principles of user-centered design, scientific modeling, and multimodal interaction.

## üß∞ Tools and Technologies Used

- **Unity 2022.3.40f1**
- **Meta Quest 2 (VR testing)**
- **Visual Studio Code (C# scripting)**
- **Shader Graph & Amplify Shader Editor**
- **Unity Particle System**
- **Timeline and Animator**
- **Post-Processing Volume (URP)**
- **OBS Studio and Loom (recording and narration)**

---

## üß± System Architecture

- **XR Rig**: Core player rig with locomotion, teleportation, and interaction support
- **Teleportation Anchors**: Used for moving between beach, hut, forest, and lab zones
- **Interactables**: Dynamic blocks, animals, and buttons with physics & XR Grab Interactables
- **UI Panels**: Floating canvases for gravity toggle, object color, and spawn/reset controls
- **Metrics Overlay**: Toggleable in-app heads-up display with FPS, block count, gravity status
- **Audio/Visual FX**: Fire crackling, fog drift, haptics, visual highlights, ambient sound

---

## üîç Key Features

- **Teleportation Hub**: Central point to reach other areas instantly
- **Interactive Characters**: Penguins, dogs, humans, butterflies, deer, giraffes, and more
- **Environmental FX**: Fog particles, fire systems, wind simulation
- **Scientific Scenes**: Gravity manipulation, weather simulation, temperature experiments
- **Two-Hand Manipulation**: Grabbing, scaling, and rotating objects with precision
- **Control Panel**: Canvas UI to spawn/reset objects and toggle gravity
- **Metrics HUD**: Frame time, FPS, and scene stats toggle with left-hand button

---

## üß™ Usability Testing Summary

- **Peer Feedback**: Navigation was intuitive but teleport points lacked clear markers; UI buttons not always visible
- **Fixes Implemented**:
  - Added glowing markers for teleport zones
  - Improved canvas placement and button highlighting
  - Enhanced object hover cues and haptic feedback
- **Questions Raised**: Consider adding onboarding prompts or tooltips for new users

## üé® Visual/Audio Enhancements

### Fog and Fire Effects

- **Fog**: Particle System simulating soft drifting mist in forest areas
- **Fire**: Animated material & crackling audio at the hut firepit

These effects increase immersion and scene realism, providing comfort and atmosphere cues to users.
